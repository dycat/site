Another concept of this coronavirus game is social distance. Social distance is about avoiding unnecessary close contact face to face with others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time for nerdy guy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long and no end hope self-quarantine days, the social person first becomes frustrating. As for me, an introvert nerdy man, it’s a time for relaxation and self-enjoyment. From Jan 23 to Feb 12, I had been stay at my home all the time. After that, the company called for recovering work, so I worked remotely in February. 
All the time since then, I find myself become more aware of my time and arranged it carefully. I’ve learned SwiftUI and iOS programming. And start my first iOS Application. Despite that I’m still in my way to finish the Application, I feel I never had a time in my life so productive.
Maybe such a long time can be a chance to reflect oneself and be ready for the next journey in the life. Especially, as a person doesn’t socially active that much. I even keep away from others on purpose.
Therefore, if there isn’t any death because of the disease, the chance to have such a time isolate from the world doesn’t that bad at all. Or in our daily life later on, if God allows us to continue, the regularly rethinking and focusing is really nice to have.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw it away&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words come from a song I highly appreciate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw it away, 
   you can throw it away,
   …
   give your love, live your life 
   each and every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— by Abbey Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe when you truly in a situation that health is been threaten, you can finally think what you have to do and what you love to do. Most things around us don’t have to do. Especially for Asians, they want to attend a famous school, buying luxury houses, having high social acknowledgment. They work pretty hard and follow the rules. But they seldom have time to do something reflects their desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A distance from others, let you have the space to decide things and take action. You can give up any goal and activity. Also, you don’t need to be apart from all your friends, family and the one you love. Just know you have the right to select, decide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Facing emergency</title><link href="https://dyang504.github.io/site/facing-emergency.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-11T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-03-11T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>ian</name></author><id>tag:dyang504.github.io,2020-03-11:/site/facing-emergency.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The beginning of 2020 is a disaster for many people in the world.

With the outbreak of Wuhan Coronavirus (WHO named 2019-), many parts of the world especially east Asian are in the shadow of fear. As the infection continues, I found this is an opportunity to thinking and take action to prepare kinds of emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of emergency we may face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depends on the different areas we live in, the possibility of disaster events may vary. But the common situation may include Extreme weather, pandemic, and fire. If your city surrounds by nuclear plants, the nuclear explosion should take into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the city I am now living in subtropical and near the sea, extreme weather may include hurricanes, floods, and extreme heat, pandemic may include dengue, influenza, fire include home fire, workplace fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What common action shall we take to prepare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation starts with having a way to receive alerts from the local weather station, CDC. For fire, get ready fire alarm in your home or office. To find ways to receive alerts, try to visit the local government’s website, local weather station’s website or CDC’s website. Or call the local government’s public help department. In your own house, having smoke detectors in rooms and a temperature sensor in the kitchen is also useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the preparation is an emergency kit. This part may consider different kinds of emergencies in your local place. The common things in your emergency kit include bottled water, emergency foods, flashlight, common medicine pills, face mask, tools like radio, large battery phone to receive and send messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next preparation is financial preparedness. In general, A six to twelve month worth of money plus some cash is enough for many kinds of accidents. As I already have an emergency fund of my one year expense, this part is almost done. All I have to do in this part is to prepare some cash. Because in my country nowadays people tend to not use cash, so I don’t have any in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Websites recommend for preparing emergency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most countries have their emergency management government department. Their websites provide much useful information to help you prepare you and your family in many unusual situations. The following are some of the websites I often refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Ready&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.ready.gov) &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;American&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.cdc.gov)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Gemerny&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BBK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.bbk.bund.de) &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Hongkong&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Department&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//www.dh.gov.hk/scindex.html)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I hope everyone has a nice and peace 2020! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category></entry></feed>
